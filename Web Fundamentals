Once the browser knows the server's IP address, it can ask the server for the web page. This is done with a HTTP GET request.

HTTPS is a secure (encrypted) version of HTTP, it works in more or less the same way. This uses TLS 1.3 (normally) encryption in order to communicate without:
-Other parties being able to read the data
-Other parties being able to modify the data

By default, HTTP runs on port 80 and HTTPS runs on port 443. Many CTFs are based around websites, so it's useful to know that if port 80 is open, there's likely a web server listening that you can attack and exploit.
What port do web server normally listen to?
80

GET request retrieves the data
POST requests are used to send data to a web server, like adding comment or performing login
A HTTP request can be broken down into parts. The first line is a verb and a path for the server, such as
GET /index.html
Here's an example for a GET request retrieving a simple JS file:

GET /main.js HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.170.129:8081
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.122 Safari/537.36
Accept: */*
Referer: http://192.168.170.129:8081/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8

From the headers, you can tell what I performed the request from (Chrome version 80, from Windows 10). This is useful for forensics and analysing packet captures.


Response from the server
A basic breakdown of the status codes is:

100-199: Information
200-299: Successes (200 OK is the "normal" response for a GET)
300-399: Redirects (the information you want is elsewhere)
400-499: Client errors (You did something wrong, like asking for something that doesn't exist)
500-599: Server errors (The server tried, but something went wrong on their side)
